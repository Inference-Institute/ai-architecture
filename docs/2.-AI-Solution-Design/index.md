# AI Solution Design

Welcome to the AI Solution Design section of our AI Solution Architect handbook. This section focuses on the practical aspects of designing and implementing AI solutions that are effective, scalable, and cost-efficient.

## Overview

Designing AI solutions requires a holistic approach that goes beyond just understanding AI technologies. It involves careful problem framing, choosing the right architecture patterns, considering scalability and performance, optimizing costs, and establishing proper evaluation metrics.
