# Securing AI Pipelines and Infrastructures  

## Introduction  

Securing AI pipelines and infrastructures is critical to protecting data, models, and systems against unauthorized access, adversarial attacks, and operational failures. AI pipelines involve multiple stages, from data ingestion to model inference, and each stage introduces potential vulnerabilities. This page provides an in-depth look at the strategies, tools, and frameworks necessary to secure AI workflows and infrastructure across on-premises, cloud, and hybrid environments.

## Objectives of Securing AI Pipelines  

1. **Protect Data**: Ensure data integrity and privacy throughout the pipeline.  
2. **Safeguard Models**: Prevent tampering with AI models during training and deployment.  
3. **Secure Infrastructure**: Harden compute, storage, and network resources against attacks.  
4. **Mitigate Threats**: Address adversarial attacks, insider threats, and operational risks.  
5. **Ensure Compliance**: Align pipelines with security and regulatory standards like GDPR and HIPAA.
