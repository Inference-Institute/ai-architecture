## AI Risk Management Framework  

An effective AI risk management framework includes the following steps:  

1. **Identify**: Catalog risks across data, model, and operations.  
2. **Assess**: Quantify risk severity and likelihood using defined metrics.  
3. **Mitigate**: Implement safeguards to reduce risks.
