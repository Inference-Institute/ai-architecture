# Zachman Framework for AI Architecture

The **Zachman Framework** is a foundational tool for designing complex systems, offering a structured way to organize and analyze architectural components. It provides a holistic perspective by categorizing information into six fundamental questions (**What**, **How**, **Where**, **Who**, **When**, and **Why**) across six perspectives or roles (e.g., Executive, Business Management, Architect).

Applying the Zachman Framework to **AI architecture** ensures clarity, alignment, and scalability by systematically addressing each dimension of the architecture, from data to processes, and from stakeholders to implementation.

---

## Overview of the Zachman Framework

The Zachman Framework organizes architecture into a two-dimensional grid:

1. **Rows (Perspectives)**: Represent stakeholder viewpoints, from executive strategies to operational details.
2. **Columns (Aspects)**: Address fundamental questions (e.g., **What** defines data, **How** defines processes).

### Zachman Framework Matrix
