# ITIL for AI Service Management  

The **ITIL (Information Technology Infrastructure Library)** framework provides a structured approach to managing IT services, ensuring alignment with business goals, efficiency, and continuous improvement. Applying ITIL principles to **AI Service Management** adapts these best practices to the unique lifecycle and operational needs of AI systems.

This page explores how ITIL processes and concepts can be tailored for managing AI services, from development and deployment to monitoring and continuous improvement.

## Overview of ITIL and AI Service Management  

ITIL organizes service management into five key stages, known as the **Service Lifecycle**:  

1. **Service Strategy**: Aligning AI services with business needs and objectives.  
2. **Service Design**: Designing AI models and systems for scalability, reliability, and compliance.  
3. **Service Transition**: Safely deploying AI models into production environments.  
4. **Service Operation**: Monitoring and maintaining AI systems for optimal performance.  
5. **Continual Service Improvement (CSI)**: Iteratively enhancing AI services to meet evolving needs.
