# AI Enterprise Solution Design & Compliance Template

**Instructions:**  
*Use this template as a strategic blueprint for designing AI solutions within an enterprise setting. Each section includes guidance and placeholders to help you align your AI initiatives with business goals, comply with global/regional regulations (e.g., EU AI Act, GDPR, HIPAA, CCPA), and maintain an auditable, transparent record of all changes. The template is intended to be a living document that evolves as regulations, technologies, and business priorities change.*

## 1. Executive Summary

**Purpose:** Offer a high-level overview of the AI initiative, its business rationale, and core objectives, ensuring alignment with corporate strategy and regulatory environments.

| **Item**               | **Details**                                                                      |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Project Name           | *e.g., Customer Churn Prediction System*                                          |
| Executive Sponsor      | *Name/Title (e.g., Chief Data Officer)*                                           |
| Business Context       | *Describe the market challenge/opportunity (e.g., high churn in EU markets).*     |
| Objectives             | *List specific targets (e.g., reduce churn by 15% in EU, improve NPS globally).*  |
| Geographical Scope     | *Enumerate regions served (e.g., EU, US, APAC) and applicable laws.*              |

*Guidance:* This section sets the stage. Revisit it regularly if business goals or regulatory conditions (e.g., expansion into a new region) change.

## 3. Data Architecture

**Purpose:** Define data sources, governance, and residency with an emphasis on traceability and compliance. Ensure the architecture supports audits (e.g., who accessed data, where it’s stored).

### 3.1 Data Inventory & Residency

| **Data Source**   | **Type**            | **Region**       | **Owner**    | **Quality Checks**         |

    subgraph US
    G["Transformations DB (US)"] -->|"ETL (US)"| H[US Data Lake]
    H --> C
    end
```

*Guidance:* Show how data never leaves certain regions if that’s required by local laws (e.g., GDPR data stays in the EU).

| **Framework/Act**  | **Type**      | **Relevant Project Stages**           | **Required Artifacts**               | **Update Frequency** |
|--------------------|---------------|---------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------|
| EU AI Act           | AI Regulation | Model Dev, Deployment, Operations     | Risk classification, decision logs, human oversight docs | Quarterly or upon model changes |
| GDPR                | Data Privacy  | Data Collection, Storage, Retention   | Consent records, DSAR logs, pseudonymization proof | Continuous, monthly audits |
| HIPAA               | Health Data   | Data Processing, Storage (US)         | Access logs, PHI masking strategies, incident reports | Monthly or after infra changes |
| CCPA                | Data Privacy  | US Customer Data Handling              | Opt-out request logs, transparency reports | As requested, yearly audit |

*Guidance:* Extend this table as you add more frameworks. For each regulation:  

- Identify applicable project stages (data ingestion, model training, deployment).  
- Specify artifacts required (logs, documentation, model sheets).  
- Define how often to review and update these artifacts.

### 8.2 Compliance Change Management

| **Change Trigger**     | **Action**                              | **Owner**              |
